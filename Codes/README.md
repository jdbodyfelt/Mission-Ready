# Codes

* `movies.py` - contains functions to fetch the movie dataset, clean it, and save to a pickled pandas dataframe. There is a default `__main__` that will run the function order and create the dataset pickle. 

* `database.py` - this contains functions to load a pickled dataframe, then inject it into a SQL database. Again, there is a default `__main__` that can be ran.
